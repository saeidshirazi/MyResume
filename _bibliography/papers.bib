  abstract={Online Social Networks (OSNs) attracted millions of
users in the world. OSNs made adversaries more passionate to
create malware variants to subvert the cyber defence of OSNs.
Through various threat vectors, adversaries persuasively lure
OSN users into installing malware on their devices at an enormous
scale. One of the most horrendous forms of named malware is
OSNs' botnets that conceal C&C information using OSNs'
accounts of unaware users. In this paper, we present GITC (Ghost
In The Cloud), which uses Telegram as a C&C server to
communicate with threat actors and access targets' information in
an undetectable way. Furthermore, we present our
implementation of GITC. We show how GITC uses the encrypted
telegram Application Programming Interface (API) to cover up
records of the adversary connections to the target, and we discuss
why current intrusion detection systems cannot detect GITC. In
the end, we run some sets of experiments that confirm the
feasibility of GITC.}

  abstract={Creating games is a costly process involving tons of vigorous efforts, time, and resources. Different game engines were introduced to facilitate the game-making process, such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot. However, despite the advent of game engines, the vacuum of automatically creating new games by computers was still felt. With artificial intelligence (AI) development and its growing presence in the industry, game developers made a new game development branch using AI. One of the essential steps in this context was the introduction of GameGAN, which inspired us for this article. Here we propose Multi-Class GamgeGan(MC-GAN), a starting point for the next generation of game engines based on GameGAN. In addition, MC-GAN is capable of classifying each desired game element and even changing its class to change the element's nature (e.g., MC-GAN can change static elements to dynamic ones â€¦}
