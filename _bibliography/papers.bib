  abstract={Online Social Networks (OSNs) attracted millions of
users in the world. OSNs made adversaries more passionate to
create malware variants to subvert the cyber defence of OSNs.
Through various threat vectors, adversaries persuasively lure
OSN users into installing malware on their devices at an enormous
scale. One of the most horrendous forms of named malware is
OSNs' botnets that conceal C&C information using OSNs'
accounts of unaware users. In this paper, we present GITC (Ghost
In The Cloud), which uses Telegram as a C&C server to
communicate with threat actors and access targets' information in
an undetectable way. Furthermore, we present our
implementation of GITC. We show how GITC uses the encrypted
telegram Application Programming Interface (API) to cover up
records of the adversary connections to the target, and we discuss
why current intrusion detection systems cannot detect GITC. In
the end, we run some sets of experiments that confirm the
feasibility of GITC.}

  abstract={Creating games is a costly process involving tons of vigorous efforts, time, and resources. Different game engines were introduced to facilitate the game-making process, such as Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot. However, despite the advent of game engines, the vacuum of automatically creating new games by computers was still felt. With artificial intelligence (AI) development and its growing presence in the industry, game developers made a new game development branch using AI. One of the essential steps in this context was the introduction of GameGAN, which inspired us for this article. Here we propose Multi-Class GamgeGan(MC-GAN), a starting point for the next generation of game engines based on GameGAN. In addition, MC-GAN is capable of classifying each desired game element and even changing its class to change the element's nature (e.g., MC-GAN can change static elements to dynamic ones …}

  abstract={In the current world, the Internet is being used almost everywhere. With the rise of IoT technology, which is one of the most used technologies, billions of IoT devices are interconnected over the Internet. However, DoS/DDoS attacks are the most frequent and perilous threat to this growing technology. New types of DDoS attacks are highly advanced and complicated, and it is almost impossible to detect or mitigate by the existing intrusion detection systems and traditional methods. Fortunately, Big Data, Data mining, and Machine Learning technologies make it possible to detect DDoS traffic effectively. This paper suggests a DDoS detection model based on data mining and machine learning techniques. For writing this paper, the latest available Dataset, CICDDoS2019, experimented with the most popular machine learning algorithms and specified the most correlated features with predicted classes are being used. It is discovered that AdaBoost and XGBoost were extraordinarily accurate and correctly predicted the type of network traffic with 100% accuracy. Future research can be extended by enhancing the model for multiclassification of different DDoS attack types and testing hybrid algorithms and newer datasets on this model.}

  abstract={The widespread deployment of sensors and linked items contributes to the rising interest in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). These are used in conjunction with other Online services to develop highly sophisticated and profitable cloud-based services. Despite significant attempts to secure them, security management remains a crucial problem for these devices, Because of their intricacy, heterogeneous nature, and resource constraints. This paper presents IoT-Shield, a data mining technique that coincides with a process mining approach for identifying misbehavior in of the kind. IoT-Shield enables the characterization of IoT devices' behavioral models and the detection of possible threats, even in the presence of diverse protocols and platforms. The underlying architecture and components are then described and formalized, and a proof-of-concept prototype is detailed. A real-world traffic dataset known as KDD-NSL is …}

  abstract={Learning was always an essential part of our lives
to acquire knowledge and move forward. However, the
increasing wages of on-campus learning leads to an increasing
need for an alternate way of learning. With the outbreak of
COVID-19, people needed to stay at home for safety. Therefore,
finding an answer to this need became more dominant. Another
major problem, especially in the ongoing decade, is the lack of
enough cybersecurity knowledge by the common folk. This
paper aims to look at a new platform that is carefully designed
to teach cybersecurity to learners with any background. We
design this system using gamification to increase the efficiency
of learning. Because modern technologies are ubiquitous in our
lives, particularly during the coronavirus outbreak, including
practical work in teaching will be quite beneficial. The practical
activity has a clear advantage, such as promoting experimental
learning and improving student abilities and skills for the future
professional career. Finally, we assess this method with a classic
learning approach using two different groups.}
