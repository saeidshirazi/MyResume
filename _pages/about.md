##### About

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Carleton University, working under the supervision of [Dr. Lianying Zhao](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~lianyingzhao/). My research focuses on cutting-edge topics in cybersecurity, including system security, IoT security, the application of machine learning to security, and smart contract security.

##### Research

As a cybersecurity researcher at the [Carleton Computer Security Lab (CCSL)](https://www.ccsl.carleton.ca/new/), I specialize in cybersecurity, big data security, and machine learning-based detection systems. Currently, my research is centered on security audits in IoT and developing security metrics. I am also exploring innovative paradigms for creating the next generation of more secure systems.


##### Content Creating
I enjoy sharing my insights and knowledge on cybersecurity, particularly on web and Android security, through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@InfoSecTube).
