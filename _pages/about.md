##### About

I’m currently a Machine Learning Scientist at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, Montreal. 
I’m working on efficient training/finetuning of large-scale deep learning systems, including the topics of decentralized learning and parameter-efficient tuning. I’m also working on the alignment and reasoning of LLMs, using process-supervised reward models and inference-time intervention.

Previously, I was a graduate student at [Mila](mila.quebec), working with [Eugene Belilovsky](https://eugenium.github.io/) and [Rahaf Aljundi](https://rahafaljundi.com/). I worked on the generalization and continual/decentralized training of deep neural networks.

I was also a research intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/), worked on asynchronous time-series forecasting and regularization techniques for neural temporal point processes.

##### Research

My research has focused on exploring innovative paradigms for the next generation of large-scale deep learning systems, given any source of supervision. These systems will exhibit continuous growth in modalities (multi-modal learning), tasks (continual learning), and computation (decentralized learning).


##### Writings

I like sharing my thoughts and writings on machine learning ideas, concepts, and applications on my [Blog](/blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naderasadi_).
